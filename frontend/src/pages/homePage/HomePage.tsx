          ISFiT is the world’s largest international student festival,taking place biennially during the 
          spring semester in Trondheim, Norway. We gather students from different national and cultural 
          backgrounds to talk and connect through exciting and engaging topics and discussions. The first 
          ever ISFiT festival was held in 1990 and ever since people from around the world has gathered
          in Trondheim every other year in unison. The next festival will happen in 2025. Each festival 
          explores a different theme, and this festival's theme is POWER!

          In a world driven by various forms of power, ISFIT25 encourages a reflective journey into 
          understanding and redefining the concept. Power, often associated with authority and control, 
          extends beyond conventional boundaries. At ISFIT, we believe in harnessing the strength of 
          influence to bring about positive change.

          The Student Peace Prize

          The Student Peace Prize (SPP) was established in 1999 – as an initiative by volunteers from the 
          International Student Festival in Trondheim (ISFiT). It is awarded biennially to a student or 
          student organization working to promote peace, human rights and democracy. The Prize is awarded 
          on behalf of all students in Norway, while an independent Student Peace Prize Committee makes 
          the selection itself. The election happens through the independent committee for the Students 
          Peace Prize, while the award itself, takes place during ISFiT’s own award ceremony.
